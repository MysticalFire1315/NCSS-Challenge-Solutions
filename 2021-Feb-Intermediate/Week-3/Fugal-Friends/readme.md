# Fugal Friends (Week 3 Part 1: While loops)

## Instructions
You're baking bread. To make it rise, you'll need the help of yeast!

Yeast is a kind of fungus. The most common kind of bread yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Every hour, the amount of Saccharomyces in a loaf can grow by 60%.

Expressed as an equation, this looks like:

$$(yeast 1 hr later) = (yeast now) + 0.6 * (yeast now)$$

Write a program that asks for the starting weight of the yeast (in grams) and its final weight. Calculate how many hours you would need to leave the loaf to rise to achieve the final weight of yeast. Output the result as a *whole number of hours*.

Your program should look like this:
```
Start (g) : 3
Finish (g): 10
The loaf would need to rise for 3 hours.
```

Another example:
```
Start (g): 1.7
Finish (g): 15.1
The loaf would need to rise for 5 hours.
```
