# Driving Me Crazy (Week 3 Part 1: Looping with string conditions)

## Instructions
Your family is going on a driving holiday! Holidays are fun! But driving? Not so much.

You want to know when you're getting to the next stop, so you keep asking your family an important question... **Are we there yet?**

Write a program that asks this question over and over again until you get an answer that includes the word `'yes'` *(with any capitalisation)* anywhere in the input. Print out `'Aww...'` if you're not there yet and print '`Hooray!!!'` when you finally arrive!

Here's an example:
```
Let's go!
Are we there yet? No
Aww...
Are we there yet? Ah I don't think so
Aww...
Are we there yet? Nope not yet
Aww...
Are we there yet? Umm oh yes here we are
Hooray!!!
```

Here's a short leg of your trip:
```
Let's go!
Are we there yet? No
Aww...
Are we there yet? Yes
Hooray!!!
```

Here's one last example:
```
Let's go!
Are we there yet? No
Aww...
Are we there yet? Nup
Aww...
Are we there yet? WE'RE NOT THERE!
Aww...
Are we there yet? yES WE'RE HERE!
Hooray!!!
```
