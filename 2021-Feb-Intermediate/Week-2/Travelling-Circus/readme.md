# Travelling Circus (Week 2 Part 1: Introducing lists)

## Instructions
You're a huge fan of **Cirque du Soleiil** and they've announcted their next world tour! The tour locations have been released, and you're wondering which countries you can see them in.

We have given you a list called `tour_locations` which has all the countries they are performing in.

Write a program that asks for a country and checks if the circus is stopping there. If the country you are checking is on the list it should output:
```
Country: Sweden
Sweden is on the list!
```

If the country you are checking is not on th elist it should output:
```
Country: Australia
We will not be in Australia this time.
```
