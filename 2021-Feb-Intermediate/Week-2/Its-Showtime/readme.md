# It's Showtime (Week 2 Part 1: Looping with lists)

## Instructions
Your band has its very first gig! What songs are you going to play?

Write a program that asks for your band name, and then for a list of space-separated song titles.

**Note: Your band only sings songs with one-word titles!**

The output should look like this:
```
Band: The One Word Wonders
Songs: Song Lyric Ballad
Please welcome to the stage, The One Word Wonders!
They will be playing...
ðŸŽµ Song
ðŸŽµ Lyric
ðŸŽµ Ballad
Give it up for The One Word Wonders!
```

Here's another example:
```
Band: Lady Gaga
Songs: Paparazzi Applause Shallow
Please welcome to the stage, Lady Gaga!
They will be playing...
ðŸŽµ Paparazzi
ðŸŽµ Applause
ðŸŽµ Shallow
