# Sesquipedalian Education (Week 4 Part 1: Introducing dictionaries)

## Instructions
A sesquipedalian is someone who uses too many big words. You're trying to become one!

Write a program that gives you the definitions of some big words to help you learn them. Appropriately, we've given you a *dictionary* containing some big words and their definitions.

Your program should ask for a word as input, then print out its definition if that word is a key in the dictionary.

Here's an example of how your program should work:
```
Enter a word: Grimalkin
A cat.
```

If a word isn't in the dictionary, a short message should be printed:
```
Enter a word: tetrapyloctomy
Not in the dictionary!
```

*All keys in the dictionary are in **lower case**.* Your program should work with input words in any case:
```
Enter a word: PSIThuRISM
The sound of wind in the trees.
```
