# Happy Campers (Week 4 Part 1: Looping with dictionaries)

## Instructions
You're running a canp for the summer and lots of different groups have enquired about booking the camp facilities!

To help you sort through the different enquiries you write a program to eliminate groups that are too big to fit in your camp.

Your program should ask how many beds you have available. Then, it should use the dictionary we've provided with the groups and their sizes to figure out which ones can fit in the camp.

Here's an example of how your program should work:
```
How many beds at the camp? 5
The groups that fit are:
Perth Pilot Academy
Melbourne Mime Society
Coriander Protection League
Sydney Soup Society
Inner-City Ibis Initiative
```

Here's another example:
```
How many beds at the camp? 16
The groups that fit are:
Perth Pilot Academy
Melbourne Mime Society
Canadian Cat Club
Coriander Protection League
Teddy's Tap Dance Troupe
Sydney Soup Society
Inner-City Ibis Initiative
Untitled Union
Smashed Avo Advocates
```
