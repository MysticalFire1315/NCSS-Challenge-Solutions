# Missing Multipliers (Week 2 Part 2: Looping with lists of numbers)

## Instructions
You're writing a program to create advanced times tables worksheets for your students.

Write a program that asks for a times table and then print the times table for numbers from 3 to 12, but with the multiplier missing. In its place, put an answer box made of square brackets around a space, like this: **[ ]**

Your program should also ask for a *step number*, and increase the multiplier by that much each row. For example, if the *step number* is 1, then the table for every multiplier from 3 to 12 is printed, like this: 
```
Times table: 2
Step: 1
2 x [ ] = 6
2 x [ ] = 8
2 x [ ] = 10
2 x [ ] = 12
2 x [ ] = 14
2 x [ ] = 16
2 x [ ] = 18
2 x [ ] = 20
2 x [ ] = 22
2 x [ ] = 24
```

If the *step number* is 4, then a table with only the multipliers 3, 7 and 11 is printed, like this: 
```
Times table: 5
Step: 4
5 x [ ] = 15
5 x [ ] = 35
5 x [ ] = 55
```

Your program should work for any times table or step number greater than 0.
