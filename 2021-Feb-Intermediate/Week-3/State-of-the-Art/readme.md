# State of the Art (Week 3 Part 2: Modifying lists)

## Instructions
The art magazine you work for is merging with another magazine. Your boss wants three name proposals for the new merged company that are puns on the word **art**.

Write a program that keeps asking for names until it's collected three containing the string `'art'` (*with any capitalisation*). It should then print the list of names in *reverse alphabetical* order, because your boss is eccentric.

Here's an example of how your program should work:
```
Magazine name: Apart
Magazine name: Pop Tart
Magazine name: Fatalistic
Magazine name: Creative Artery
Proposals: Pop Tart, Creative Artery, Apart
```

Here's another example:
```
Magazine name: The Artemis
Magazine name: prty hrd
Magazine name: heartless
Magazine name: Paper Crane
Magazine name: smartypants
Proposals: smartypants, heartless, The Artemis
```
